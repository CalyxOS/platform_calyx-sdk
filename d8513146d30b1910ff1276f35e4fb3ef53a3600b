      "message": "Finally an explanation for the issue we were seeing before:\n\nWhen SQLiteOpenHelper calls onUpgrade, it does so [within a transaction of its own](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/android-13.0.0_r54:frameworks/base/core/java/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteOpenHelper.java;l\u003d408-423).\n\nTransactions can be nested, but if any nested transaction fails, the whole outer transaction will be rolled back. (So much for nesting...)\n\nAnd when we were reading a value within a transaction, we were not setting that transaction as successful. So it failed the entire outer upgrade transaction, rolling it back.\n\nHere\u0027s the [doc for beginTransaction](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/android-13.0.0_r54:frameworks/base/core/java/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase.java;l\u003d626-633):\n```\n     * Begins a transaction in EXCLUSIVE mode.\n     * \u003cp\u003e\n     * Transactions can be nested.\n     * When the outer transaction is ended all of\n     * the work done in that transaction and all of the nested transactions will be committed or\n     * rolled back. The changes will be rolled back if any transaction is ended without being\n     * marked as clean (by calling setTransactionSuccessful). Otherwise they will be committed.\n```",
